# sequelizeBurger - a Sequelized Eat-Da-Burger!

* sequelizeBurger is a sequelized (i.e., mySQL --> Sequelize) version of Eat-Da-Burger, a restaurant burger logger app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page (making it "devoured").

* Once devoured, the user can click the `YUM!` button to "resurrect" the burger and move it back to the left side of the page. The user can then click the `Devour it!` button again to repeat the process and have the burger be devoured again.

* The app will store every burger in the database, whether devoured or not.

* Implemented client-side, server-side, and database validation for "burger name cannot be null" and "burger name must be between 1 and 35 characters".

* Implemented default false for burger's devoured status

* Implemented Sequelize-CLI migration
